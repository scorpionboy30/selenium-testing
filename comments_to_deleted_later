It is a very good start.

Some suggestions:
- Need to understand camel-casing. what you have presented is not camel-casing for naming conventions.
- Variables need to be given some access modifiers. Don't just rely on default. 
Shows that you have a undertanding of access control.
- TestNG concept is not what you have presented here. Need to revisit the concept. TestNG is an xml file and not a .java file.
Your .java file is your testplan which has different tests for certain functionalities.

Next Iteration changes:
- Make the current TestNG.java file shorter. See if you can identify some lines of code which can be used by multiple tests.
And make them functions in another classes.
- Current implementation of Page.java has both locators and functions hardcoded in one.
Make them separate in two different classes. Page inheriting locators.
- Data provider should be able to provide you object as a whole rather than individual parameters like you have.
This will make the signature of your test functions shorter.
